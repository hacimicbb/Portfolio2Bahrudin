            <p>This is my first project in the App Academy class. The main scheme is lightning, I don"t know exactly why I did lightning as my main scheme but I thought it would be cool and neat. <br /> Making a website is new for me as I never had any experience of making my own. I think it's a great experience to learn how to make my very own website so I can make new projects in the future. <br />I really want to learn how to make projects like games, movies, and other websites. </p>
